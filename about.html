        <h1>Beyond the Resume</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Hey there! I’m Vinayak Sabu, a curious mind from the heart of Kerala, India, who loves exploring the vast universe of technology and creativity. By day, I’m a B.Tech student in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE), diving deep into circuits and code. By night (or whenever inspiration strikes), I’m a storyteller with pixels and code—building websites, editing videos, and dreaming up ideas to make the world a little better.

My journey so far has been a mix of ambition and exploration.On the flip side, I’m also the go-to person for web design and social media strategy at my workplace—crafting digital experiences that resonate.

When I’m not geeking out on tech, you’ll find me chasing sunsets, planning my next adventure, or lost in a movie that makes me rethink life. I believe in storing memories as much as I love creating them—be it through travel, photography, or heartfelt conversations.

At my core, I’m a dreamer with a purpose: to build a meaningful career, make my family proud, and give back in ways that matter—like supporting education and uplifting others. This little corner of the web is my way of sharing my journey, my work, and maybe a spark of inspiration. Thanks for stopping by—let’s connect and create something extraordinary!</p>
